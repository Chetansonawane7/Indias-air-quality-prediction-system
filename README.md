# Indias-air-quality-prediction-system
This the Machine Learning Project made for interest in the feild and to learn how the things works actually.<br>
This model will predict the future Air quality of the india.<br>
The database used in this project is obtained from the kaggle datasets.<br> 
This data contains the information since 2017 to 2022, so this is the latest data to predict the air quality.<br>
main field of data is the PM2.5 value which describes the fine particulate matter air pollutant level in air.<br>
this project built in python programming language with following libraries--<br>
Pandas<br>
Numpy<br>
FB Prophet : this is the important library designed by Facebook for the forcasting data like air-pollution, stock-value etc.
<br>It can be installed by using the commands as follows--<br><br>
using pip: pip install prophet<br><br>
using conda: conda install conda-forge::prophet<br><br>
you can find prophet documentation here https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api I have made changes in my dataset as requirements given by the prophet in the documentation<br>
